## Introduction

This project aims to detect and recognize faces of players in sports images or video streams. It leverages OpenCV, Haar Cascades, and other computer vision techniques to identify and extract player faces. The project can be used for sports analytics, player identification, and more.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images or video streams.
- **Player Recognition**: Recognizes specific players using pre-trained models or custom datasets.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing live video feeds.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Simple CLI and API for integration into other projects.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/theabhishek26/Players_face_detector.git
   cd Players_face_detector
   

2. **Install dependencies**:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. **Download pre-trained models** (if applicable):
   Place the pre-trained models in the `models/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the face detector on an image**:
    python detect_faces.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   

2. **Run the face detector on a video stream**:
   python detect_faces.py --video path/to/video.mp4


3. **Recognize players**:
    python recognize_players.py --image path/to/image.jpg


For more options, use the `--help` flag with any script.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **Haar Cascades**: For face detection.
- **Deep Learning Models**: For player recognition (if applicable).
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
